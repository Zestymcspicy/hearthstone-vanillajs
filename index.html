          Hearthstone is a residential facility located in Lawrence, Kansas dedicated to helping
          adult men serious about recovering from their addictions to alcohol, drugs or both.&nbsp;
          It was founded in 1982 by a group of six men in recovery with the intention of helping
          others achieve what they had accomplished.&nbsp; Since that time, hundreds of men
          from all walks of life, all races and multiple nationalities have made Hearthstone
          their home as part of their recovery journey.

          Hearthstone can accommodate up to ten residents at a time and it is governed by
          a non-resident Board of Directors drawn from the recovery community in Lawrence,
          some of whom are former residents themselves.&nbsp; Hearthstone has no affiliation
          with any other organization
          but residents are required to participate in a 12-step recovery program while
          in residence.&nbsp; Frequent meetings of the relevant organizations are held within
          easy walking distance of the facility.

        <div class="front-page-text" id="fourth-paragraph">
          The current cost of residence at Hearthstone is $105 per week, split between $65
          for rent and $40 for a food fund which is administered by the residents.&nbsp; Residents
          are required to support themselves while in residence via meaningful work, but no
          money is required upon admission.&nbsp; More requirements for living at Hearthstone
          are shown on the <a class="in-text-link" href="responsibilities.html">RESPONSIBILITIES</a> page and the procedure for applying is
          outlined on the <a class="in-text-link" href="application.html">APPLICATIONS</a> page.
