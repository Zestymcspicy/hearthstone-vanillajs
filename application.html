          Applicants for admission to Hearthstone are interviewed at house meetings held from
          6 p.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday through Thursday evenings.&nbsp; In order to be interviewed,
          applicants must:
          <ul class="no-list-style">
            <li>Not have used drugs or alcohol within 72 hours of the interview</li>
            <li>Be able to move in within 72 hours if accepted</li>
          </ul>
          It is advisable to:
          <ul class="no-list-style">
            <li>Call first in order to determine availability</li>
            <li>Arrive between 5:00 and 5:30 on the designated day in order to have the opportunity
              to become more familiar with Hearthstone</li>
          </ul>
          <p> Applicants are interviewed on a first-come, first-served basis and no waiting list
            is maintained.&nbsp; If someone is accepted but does not move in within 72 hours,
            the opening is made available to others and he must re-interview.</p>
          <p> If Hearthstone is at its capacity when someone calls, he is encouraged to call back
            frequently as there is no way to predict when openings will become available.</p>
