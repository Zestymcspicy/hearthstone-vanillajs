        &nbsp Hearthstone began with an informal meeting of six members of the
        recovering community in the fall of 1980. They felt there was a need for
        men’s halfway house and set to work.  They decided to open a facility as
        soon as possible and to clearly define the goals and objectives.
        It was decided to:</p>
        <ol class="history-list">
          <li> Provide a home atmosphere with room and board with friendly,
             understanding supervision.</li>
          <li> To provide guidance in the AA program and counseling in life
             problems directed toward long term lasting sobriety.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          &nbsp; The first name chosen was The Lawrence Transitional Center Inc.
          The original incorporators were Bob Graves, Link Hughes, Rex Keith,
          Jack Landreth, Roy Neal, and John Weatherwax.  In January of 1981
          Fred McElhanie was President and the name of the organization was
          changed to LAWRENCE ALCOHOLIC RECOVERY HOUSE INC. From the beginning
          it was decided that it would be a not for profit corporation and
          that none of the board of directors would be remunerated in any way.
          The only person to be paid was the cook.  Since the formal name of
          the corporation was so long Hearthstone was chosen as the "everyday
          name."
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp; One of the founders, Roy Neal, had some prior experience with halfway
          houses and he compiled the "house rules" and "recovery agreements."
          Many people in the recovering community made contributions to get
          Hearthstone started. Volunteers on the first board worked to get all
          the legalities taken care of, articles of incorporation written and
          registered with the secretary of state etc.
        </p>
        <p>
        &nbsp; It was recognized that the people that the board was trying to help
        would in many cases be destitute and might take a while before they
        could get a job and pay their own way. Therefore ongoing sources of
        funding were needed. They decided to avoid entanglements with State and
        Federal funding and rely on local sources instead.  The Rice foundation,
        Plymouth Church, 1st Presbyterian Church and the Lutheran Church helped
        out up until the mid 90’s.
        </p>
        <p>
        &nbsp; In 1983 one of the board members kept track and found that the
        residents paid 42% of Hearthstones operating budget. The first facility was
        located at 1132 Ohio in Lawrence, Ks. It was leased to the board of
        directors by Jack and Betty Landreth at a reduced rate. It opened its
        doors in Feb. 1982 and its 1st resident was one Charlie C. a well known
        local character. He was, by default, house manager and cook. Not long
        after that the fire dept found Tony P. asleep on their couch. They
        called Roy Neal, The first director of Hearthstone, and we had our 2nd
        resident.
      </p>
        <p>
        &nbsp; The house meetings were run by Jack Landreth, Paul Smart, Roy
        Neal and Fred McElhanie. Men of every description came and tried to
        begin a program of recovery. Some were just kids who’d had a bad
        experience and wanted to get into a clean environment for awhile. Others
        ran the gamut of human experience. Some stayed a few days, some a few
        weeks and others several months. One fellow was there for two hours and
        left without his suitcase. Others have lived there for as long as 2
        years. Several men have attended college while living at Hearthstone
        with some completing degrees and graduating. Others couldn’t find a job
        and had to leave. All were given the opportunity and exposed to people
        with long term sobriety. We hope that they all took something with them
        that will prove helpful in their lives. It became standard practice to
        invite successful residents to continue involvement with Hearthstone
        after moving out. Several have done that thru the years and have gone on
        to contribute time and service as members of the board. This is a
        wonderful way to stay active in recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
        In 1987 the board had 2 big problems.
        </p>
        <ol class="history-list">
          <li> We were in debt about $4000.</li>
          <li> Jack Landreth was retiring and had to sell 1132 Ohio.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
        &nbsp; In January 1987 there was a board meeting at the 1st. national
        bank. Jack Landreth, Kerry Knudesen, Paul Smart, Joe Schoonover, Bill
        North and Garry Braddy were present. There was much discussion about
        what to do. We talked about grants and loans but soon realized that
        would take to much time. We even talked about just closing down. Finally
        we agreed that we just didn’t know what to do but we had till April. So
        when we closed, we held hands and asked God to help us because we didn’t
        know what to do.
        </p>
        <p>
        &nbsp; A couple of weeks later we heard rumors of a 5 bedroom house for
        rent at 745 Ohio. Upon tracking down the rumor we were discovered that
        Betty Allen was the trustee for the estate that owned the house and
        furthermore the trust stipulated that the house be used for civic and
        charitable purposes. She leased the house to Hearthstone at a vastly
        reduced rate and spent most of the escrow repairing the porch, kitchen
        and showers. The house at 1132 Ohio could handle 7 residents. What
        furniture we had was pretty well beat up. The house at 745 Ohio could
        accommodate 10 residents so we needed quite a lot of furniture. 3 of us
        went to our respective churches and put a notice in the bulletins asking
        for furniture for the men’s halfway house. The following week we got
        enough donations of old furniture to fill the house. Co-incidentally the
        house at 745 Ohio was located ½ block north of the employment service, 1
        block from the Al-ano club; the swimming pool and library were close.
        The bus route was handy. Several meetings were within walking distance
        as was the downtown and campus areas. We were pretty impressed with the
        answers to our prayers and decided that we were on the right track.
        Feeling somewhat empowered after all these miracles, we began to
        institute some changes to the original operating system. The requirement
        for Antabuse was dropped. We raised the room and board from $55 per week
        to $65 per week. We separated rent from food. Under the old system room
        and board was one item and we had a charge account for the residents at
        Kroger’s for groceries. One month we noticed that 5 residents had
        charged $1200 worth of groceries. We decided that change was in order.
        So rent went to $40 per week and we put the residents in charge of their
        own chow fund and recommended that they chip in $25 per week per man.
        We began to manage the house more closely, paying more attention to
        residents finding work and paying rent with cash rather than promises.
        We found that the change had been good for us as an organization and as
        individuals. Making the residents responsible for their own food seemed
        to empower them as well.
        </p>
        <p>
        &nbsp; Almost immediately the house filled to its capacity of ten
        residents. The cast of characters that became our teachers was amazing.
        People from all walks of life showed up to give sobriety a try. Some
        made it on the first try and are happy productive people today. Others
        made several tries. We try to limit attempts at Hearthstone to 3 in
        order to avoid “ENABLING”. However some have managed to worm their way
        back in as many as 5 times over a period of years. They manage this by
        coming for an interview when a new board member is conducting the meeting.
        When this happens we try to “make room for a miracle” because we know
        they happen. From that time in 1987 till the present year we’ve been
        able to pay all of our expenses, buy furniture and appliances as needed,
        keep a prudent reserve and help with a great many repairs and
        improvements to the house. I.e. Rewiring, new furnace and
        air-conditioning, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
        &nbsp; Since many of the residents leave without paying, we count these
        facts high on our list of miracles.
        </p>
        <p>
        &nbsp; Approximately 100 men try Hearthstone every year. So over the 31
        years of its existence it’s touched a lot of lives; especially when the
        families are factored in. More than once we have seen individuals who
        have failed miserably and repeatedly at Hearthstone show up a few years
        later sober and productive. God knows how but we hope that Hearthstone
        was somehow helpful. Many people have served on the Board of directors
        thru the years. The original incorporators were, Bob Graves, Link
        Hughes, Rex Keith, Jack Landreth and Roy Neal.
